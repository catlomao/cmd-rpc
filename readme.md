no
# UPDATE THERE IS LINUX SUPPORT JUST USE THE rpc.bat for linux (you need to install bat extension support first before running it!)

I build it using paper and convert it to .exe so it would work without needing to install paper on your computer

I had some problems with making it 24/7 but i will fix it soon!
